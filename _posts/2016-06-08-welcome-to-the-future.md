# Welcome to the future.

I'm going to try to do this again. I'm not sure if, or how, it will work, or if I have anything interesting or unique to say now that anyone and everyone can make snarky comments about things over social media. Maybe keeping this apart from those snarky comments will lend some amount of distinction.

At the end of the day, though, it's about friction. Maintaining the old site became way too much of a hassle, mostly because I had hacked the infrastructure of MovableType to the point where I couldn't easily un-hack it in order to keep the backend up to date. Will it be different this time? We'll find out.
